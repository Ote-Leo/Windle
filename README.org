#+title: Windle: A common windowing library for Rust

This library provides standard types  for accessing a window's platform-specific
raw window handle and display's  platform-specific raw display handle. This does
not provide any utilites for creating  and managing window; instead, it provides
a common interface  that window creation libraries (e.g. Winit,  SDL) can use to
easily talk with graphics libraries (e.g. gfx-hal).
